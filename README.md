# Project 2: Initial exploration and data visualization

Databox company provided an anonymized and sampled dataset on their platform usage data. Our task was to get brief owerview of the data, explore it andvisualize some interesting things. 



## Instructions

I used both Python and R for work. At first I wanted to do first data reprocessing in Python and then continuing in R but due to loack of tehnicall ability in R  in between I 
went back to python for preprocessing and to R only for visualizations. All aditional instructions are in notebooks. First preproccesing (adding headers to some csv files) 
is done in first part of jupyter notebook. After that is time to run seperate R script "plot1.R" to create first visualization "events_over_time.png". 
Then it's time to run "project-2.rmd" R markdown. Twice in between you must go back to jupyter notebook to run some aditional preprocessing. This is in line 225 and 285 of R markdown file.
Visualizations that were not used in report were deleted or commented.
